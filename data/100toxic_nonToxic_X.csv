"paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  however, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  and multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.  the major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with."

"paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  however, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  and multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.  the major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with."

"""== attributing and classifying of personalities ==  invitation. your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed.  some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. i propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. necessity however to follow certain classifying remains.   my initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of lithuanian national renaissance period: some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. this definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of lithuania.  we should distinguish leading ideas of the nat. renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. cultural aspirations of the later nat. ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of lithuania. but they accented also expression of lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  lithuanian. i mean, that such authors in as  čiurlionis is seen as modernist in lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of lithuanian culture, when in european or world-wide context. a parallel  example may be taken from literature of india. poet  tagore, well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india. making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture. but in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. this way also lithuanian cultural leaders of the n. ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in lithuanian context. they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting western people with lithuanian culture than for their direct input into western culture. čiurlionis is the best example here.  in other way, the later lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life (see the table below).  we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. the problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. so, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. especially in the soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. e. g. philosopher ramūnas bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).     period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the national renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  čiurlionis, painter kazys šimonis, poet and philosopher vilius storastas - vydūnas, dramatist sofija kymantaitė - čiurlionienė, poets adomas jakštas, motiejus gustaitis, liudas gira, composer stasys šimkus, philosopher ramūnas bytautas.  reformers and innovators of lithuanian culture representatives of lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them. the period between wwi and wwii and post-war years.   poets v mykolaitis - putinas, kazys binkis, writer ignas šeinius – jurkūnas, artists: all 'ars' group,  philosopher juozas girnius  modernists, introducing new western ideas into lithuanian cultural life  central european modernism.  note: lists of personalities isn't complete here, nor it's made precisely by prominence.   07:51, 2004 jul 16 (utc)  """

"i don't at all propose that it should be transcribed as [meːn] in this or any other article.  if anything at all, just a brief mention of the raising of trap and mouth in a pre-nasal environment would suffice.  i just thought it was an american thing to raise  before nasals (i do it myself), but i often hear aussies do it quite a bit as well, and i don't hear english people do it at all.  the only difference is that americans have a tendency to diphthongize it as well as raising it.   i'm not really surprised you don't have a broad accent, being a wikipedian.  i'm not saying it's not possible. you're right; i was just kind of thinking aloud."
"homosexuals are intent on legitimizing their behavior. therefore, they will seize any opportunity to suggest that famous persons are gay. in this way, their way of life will be received as being not only harmless, but perfectly normal. as generations of people grow from childhood to maturity and are exposed to this strategy, they increasingly develop a tolerance for homosexuality. in this way, it is now almost universally accepted as a diverse or alternate behavior or way of being, similar to a religion, race,  or nationality. lestrade"

"invite    hi! i still did not have time to write the articles about the fundamentals of the romani culture and society (that would have permitted a normal presentation, beyond the stereotypes), i hope in the near future i'll manage to do it. from the last discussion i just managed to organize better category:romani people by country and category:romani people by occupation and create some more articles about romani persons."

"""   randroide answers to """"next step""""   guys, i do not see you taking steps to wikipedia:requests for mediation.  i can not do this job because i always connect from """"filtered"""" institutional net-access, and following those steps could result in new, undesired, controversial """"truncation"""" of words by the software. i do not want that happenning.  could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided?. thank you.    randroide answers to new reference by burgas00     at last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: the false """"suicidal"""" terrorists from prisa will also be included there.   come oooooon, boys, start writing that section. i do not want all the kudos for myself: the new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me.   but remember: npov and sources, all the sources. just like me citing """"el país"""" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. cheers       indeed, a good point. and all the remarks in cope too. and the """"moral certitudes"""" of mariano rajoy published in el mundo.    i agree with you 100%, larean.    what randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely pov, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. also, all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers - npov it is not.     you are right, southofwatford, in your """"randroide omits..."""" section.  if you have not subscription to """"el país"""", i am sorry but that´s your problem. my """"institutional"""" access also has some advantages, like paid access to """"el país"""" (and many, many other publications and books). that´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of """"filtered"""" internet accesss: it´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.  do you see?. the truncation of words is offsett (i think) by better sources.  btw, if you write under a """"randroide answers"""" section you are: invading """"my"""" space. i do not mind, really. but you are doing it. risking new truncations on your messages. to avoid this, please write outside """"randroide answers"""" sections.  if you think that the proposed article is pov, work in it to make it npov. the article is not """"mine"""".    i'll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it's very short. the issue is not whether i subscribe to el país, its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it. all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.      all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  very funny, southofwatford.   i am going to follow this joke of yours.  please propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book. delete all references to tv or radio stations, because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home. delete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.  it´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. i had a good laugh.  user:southofwatford  how strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it's simply bizarre. equally, in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.   08:3"
