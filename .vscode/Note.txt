Embedding Matrix Dimensions:
Rows: 250 (matching your vocabulary size).
    Columns: Start with a range of 50-100 dimensions.
    Adjust based on task complexity and computational resources.
    Monitor performance and experiment with different values.
    Max Sequence Length:

Consider:
    Average sentence length in your data.
    Distribution of sentence lengths.
    Longest sentences you want the model to handle.
    Common Range: 50-100 words for many tasks.
    Adjust: If dealing with longer sequences or requiring more context.

Factors to Consider:
Data Complexity:
    Simple tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis) often work well with 1-2 hidden layers.
    Complex tasks (e.g., machine translation) might require more layers to model intricate relationships.

Model Capacity:
    More hidden layers increase model capacity to learn complex patterns, but can also lead to overfitting.
    Balance capacity with regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

Computational Resources:
    More layers demand more memory and processing power during training.
    Consider available resources when designing the architecture.
    Common Practices:
    Many text classification tasks achieve good results with 1-3 hidden layers.
    Start with a simple architecture and add layers as needed.

Specific Recommendations for Your Case:
    Start with 1 or 2 hidden layers: With an embedding matrix of 300x100, a single hidden layer might suffice for simpler tasks.
    Experiment with different configurations: Try different combinations of layers and neurons to find the optimal setup.
    Monitor model performance: Use validation data to track accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.
    Increase layers cautiously: Add layers only if model performance stagnates or more complexity is needed.
    Regularize to prevent overfitting: Use techniques like dropout or L1/L2 regularization to control model complexity.
